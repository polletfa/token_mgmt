.TH TOKEN_MGMT 8

.SH NAME
token_mgmt \- create and manage security tokens for disk encryption.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B token_mgmt \fICOMMAND\fR [\fIPARAMS\fR...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
token_mgmt can be used to create and manage physical security tokens holding keys for disk encryption using cryptsetup. Any block device can be used as a token (external disk, memory card, USB flash drive...).
.PP
The keys are stored encrypted and a decryption key is kept on the computer. Decryption of disks encrypted using a key generated by token_mgmt can only be done with a valid token and the associated decryption key.
.PP
token_mgmt runs as a boot service. It checks all known block devices for a valid token and decrypt the disks if a token is found. Additionnal configuration provided on the token (profile made up of one or more overlays) can also be applied.

.TP
.BR \-l
Load only (don't mount the overlays or decrypt the disks).

.SH READ A DISK KEY
.B getkey
.IR DISK
.PP
Print the key for the disk to the standard output. The key is retrieved from the currently loaded token.

.PP
General configuration
.IP DISKS 10
List of encrypted disks
.IP MAILTO
User to receive notifications of unauthorized boots.
.IP BACKUP

.IP COLUMNS
Dimensions of the login terminal
.IP LINES

.PP
\fITOKEN_MANAGEMENT\fR/picture

\fITOKEN_MANAGEMENT\fR/profiles/*
.PP
A profile is a custom configuration that is loaded on top of the system configuration when the token is loaded. A token contains a profile made of multiple overlays.
.PP
\fITOKEN_MANAGEMENT\fR/overlays/*
.PP
Overlays are configuration units that can be included in profiles.

.SH GETTING STARTED
.IP "1) Create the first token"
token_mgmt create none
.IP "2) Load the token"
token_mgmt load \-l
.IP "3) Retrieve the disk keys to encrypt the disks"
\fIENCRYPTION_COMMAND\fR \-\-key\-file <( token_mgmt getkey \fUDISK\fR )
.IP "4) Create additional tokens for safety."

.SH WARNING
CAREFUL! IF YOU LOSE ALL ACTIVE TOKENS OR THEIR ASSOCIATED KEYS, THE DISK KEYS ARE LOST FOREVER!
.PP
MAKE SURE YOU KEEP SEVERAL VALID TOKENS IN A SAFE AND SECURE PLACE AND KEEP A BACKUP OF THE TOKEN
DECRYPTION KEYS AS WELL (BY USING THE BUILT-IN BACKUP FUNCTIONALITY OR ANY OTHER BACKUP TOOL).
