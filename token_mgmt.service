#
# Note: if you have ZFS pools on encrypted devices,
# you should disable zfs-import-cache and delete the
# zpool cache (/etc/zfs/zpool.cache).
# Otherwise, these devices would be removed from the cache
# after a failed attempt to load a token and would need to
# be reimported manually on the next boot.
# Scanning for ZFS pools on each boot solves this issue.
