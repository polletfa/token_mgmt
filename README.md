# token_mgmt

## Name

token_mgmt \- create and manage security tokens for disk encryption.

## Synopsis
**token_mgmt** *COMMAND* [*PARAMS*...]

## Description

token_mgmt can be used to create and manage physical security tokens holding keys for disk encryption using cryptsetup. Any block device can be used as a token (external disk, memory card, USB flash drive...).

The keys are stored encrypted and a decryption key is kept on the computer. Decryption of disks encrypted using a key generated by token\_mgmt can only be done with a valid token and the associated decryption key.

token\_mgmt runs as a boot service. It checks all known block devices for a valid token and decrypt the disks if a token is found. Additionnal configuration provided on the token (profile made up of one or more overlays) can also be applied.

## Commands
* create - Create token
* disable - Disable a token
* list - List tokens
* load - Load a token
* getkey - Read a disk key from a token
* status - Print status
* log - Print log

## Create token

**create** [**\-n** *NAME*] [**\-p** *PROFILE*] [**\-P**] [**\-w**] [**\-f**] *DEVICE*

Create a new token.

If no valid token exists, new disk keys are generated. Otherwise, a valid token needs to be loaded and the keys are extracted from the token.

* \-n - Name
* \-p - Add profile to the token.
* \-P - Create partition.
* \-w - Wipe the device before writing the token.
* \-f - Do not request confirmation (with -p and -w).

## Disable token

**disable** [**\-f**] *TOKEN*

Disable a token. This cannot be undone.

* \-f - Do not request confirmation.

## List tokens

**list** [**\-a**]

List active tokens.

* \-a - List all tokens.

## Load a token

**load** [**\-l**]

Load the token (decrypt disks and activate custom configuration).

* \-l - Load only (don't mount the overlays or decrypt the disks).

## Read a disk key

**getkey** *DISK*

Print the key for the disk to the standard output. The key is retrieved from the currently loaded token.

## Print status

**status**

Print the systemd status for the service.

## Print log

**log** [**\-a**]

Print the systemd log for the service (since boot).

* \-a - Print all logs

## Configuration

*TOKEN_MANAGEMENT*/config

General configuration

* DISKS - List of encrypted disks
* MAILTO - User to receive notifications of unauthorized boots.
* BACKUP - Remote directory for rsync backup of the keys in the format *USER*@*HOST*:*PATH*
* COLUMNS - Dimensions of the login terminal
* LINES - Used to position the "Access Denied" picture in the middle of the screen when the computer starts without valid token.

*TOKEN_MANAGEMENT*/picture

Picture displayed on the login console on unauthorized boots. The picture is written in /etc/issue.

Each pixel is represented by a number:
* 0 - Black
* 1 - Red
* 2 - Green
* 3 - Yellow
* 4 - Blue
* 5 - Magenta
* 6 - Cyan
* 7 - White

*TOKEN_MANAGEMENT*/profiles/\*

A profile is a custom configuration that is loaded on top of the system configuration when the token is loaded. A token contains a profile made of multiple overlays.

*TOKEN_MANAGEMENT*/overlays/\*

Overlays are configuration units that can be included in profiles.

## Getting started

1) Create the first token

    token_mgmt create none

2) Load the token

    token_mgmt load -l

3) Retrieve the disk keys to encrypt the disks

    ENCRYPTION_COMMAND --key-file <( token_mgmt getkey UDISK )

4) Create additional tokens for safety.

## Warning

CAREFUL! IF YOU LOSE ALL ACTIVE TOKENS OR THEIR ASSOCIATED KEYS, THE DISK KEYS ARE LOST FOREVER!

MAKE SURE YOU KEEP SEVERAL VALID TOKENS IN A SAFE AND SECURE PLACE AND KEEP A BACKUP OF THE TOKEN
DECRYPTION KEYS AS WELL (BY USING THE BUILT-IN BACKUP FUNCTIONALITY OR ANY OTHER BACKUP TOOL).
